md or .md stands for markdown and is typically used to generate a summary of comments at the bottom of projects, or within project file directories to explain the use of the application or program, or steps on how to use it. Git hub uses markdown because of its easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform. GitHub chose to use md over html because of how lightweight md is and how effective it is to stylize small summaries of text easily and quickly. Markdown also allows you to write using an easy-to-read text format, then convert it to structurally valid HTML.
